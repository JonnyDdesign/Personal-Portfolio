      <p>Hi! I'm Jon Desserres, a web designer and developer, based in Chandler, Arizona. After working as a teacher for five years and commercial real estate appraiser for nearly six years, Iâ€™ve decided to take the leap to pursue a career in web development. My journey began on Codecademy, and my knowledge continues to expand and develop as time goes on. I love to learn new technologies and look forward to working together to create amazing projects. Outside of developing, I enjoy spending time with my family, watching and playing sports, being a car enthusiast, animal lover, cooking, baking, and photography.</p>

          <img src="images/Dapper Dane's Doughnuts Snapshot.webp" alt="preview of Dapper Dane's Doughnuts landing page displayed on a laptop and mobile phone">
          <p>This website was inspired by my son and his love for doughnuts. I wanted to incorporate fun and lively colors and designed a logo using an AI generated image with Canva. I developed the site utilizing HTML and CSS, with a goal of being visually appealing, fast, and responsive.</p>

          <p>If you have not guessed by now, I love <span style="color: #f7702d;">ARIZONA</span> and am a proud native Arizonan! So why not develop a travel blog showcasing the beautiful state of Arizona. Join me in a journey exploring the state and finding cool spots that make Arizona, Arizona. I designed the logo using Canva, incorporated colors representing AZ, and overall wanted to create a responsive site that anyone can access and enjoy. I developed the site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

          <p>The local ski spot in Tucson, Arizona is a quaint little spot called Mount Lemmon. I have fond memories of getting out onto that snowy mountain and shredding the slopes. Therefore, I had to create a website for my childhood ski resort. I designed the logo with Canva, and developed the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

          <p>Black, white, and gold are three colors that I envisioned for an elegant and sophisticated site. And why not create an investment site whose name was inspired by the initials of my children. As for now, the site represents a landing page with additional pages coming soon. The site was designed and developed using HTML and CSS.</p>
